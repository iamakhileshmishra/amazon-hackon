# amazon-hackon Project Submission by cool_as_code

We as a team worked on the theme Customer Trust so that to increase the trust of the customer on Amazon as a Brand.

For this we worked on 3 Major Ideas that can increase this trust. 
This involves identifying and removing counterfeit products off the shelf, ensuring high value items are not swapped along the way, enabling checkpoints that goods are not damaged enroute.

Implementation:- 
1. Resolving Counterfeit Issue
2. Resolving Enroute Damage
3. Resolving Enroute swaps

### For More Details regarding Idea and Implementation Refer to this ppt [cool_as_code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vquKEo5LQ4xLaKzZgG7SK8mUna8RDjJ3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114368073471565357702&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Git Commands to Clone 

1. Create a folder in your Desktop
2. Open GitBash or Terminal 

```
git clone git@github.com:iamakhileshmishra/amazon-hackon.git
```
**We suggest you to clone it using SSH rather than the url as it is a large project and cloning from https: link may lead to issues.**


## After cloning Your Folder will have two sub Folders 
1. Web-app 
2. Machine-Learning-Damaged-Box-Classifier

## Both the folders are of different part

The Web-app folder contains the Amazon Like Shopping Website where we have resolved the Counterfiet Issue and Enroute Swap issue.

The ML folder is for the Enroute Damage Identiication.

## To Run the Project Locally

1. For Web-app  Refer to the [Web-app Readme](https://github.com/iamakhileshmishra/amazon-hackon/blob/master/Web-app/README.md)

2. For Machine Learning Part Refer to the [Machine-Learning-Damaged-Box-Classifier Readme](https://github.com/iamakhileshmishra/amazon-hackon/blob/master/Machine-Learning-Damaged-Box-Classifier/README.md)
