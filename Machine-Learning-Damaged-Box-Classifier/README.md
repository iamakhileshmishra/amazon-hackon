# Implmentation :
In our Machine  Learning Model we have trained our model with around 300 sample images in which we have used some google images of box and some actual photo of box from different diamension. 

Our CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Algorithm process the image and classify it as dameged or not dameged by the help of the trained model.
